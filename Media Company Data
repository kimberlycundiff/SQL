For this project, I downloaded data about a media compnay, and came up with relevant questions to answer about the data utilizing SQL!

#How many employees were hired in Calgary in 2003?

SELECT COUNT(employeeid)
FROM CHINOOK.employees
WHERE city='Calgary'
AND hiredate like '%2003%';

#Show all customers assigned to Margaret Park (employee id 4)

SELECT customer.customerid
, customer.firstname AS customerfirst
, customer.lastname AS customerlast
, employee.firstname AS employeefirst
, employee.lastname AS employeelast
FROM chinook.customers customer
LEFT JOIN chinook.employees employee
ON customer.supportrepid=employee.employeeid
WHERE employee.employeeid=4;

#Which genre has generated the most revenue, and what is the total revenue?

SELECT genre.name, SUM(pay.unitprice*pay.quantity) AS revenue
FROM chinook.genres genre
JOIN chinook.tracks track
ON genre.genreid=track.genreid
JOIN chinook.invoice_items pay
ON track.trackid=pay.trackid
GROUP BY genre.name
ORDER BY revenue desc
LIMIT 1;

#Which playlist has the most tracks?

SELECT playlistid, COUNT(trackid) AS tracks
FROM chinook.playlist_track
ORDER BY COUNT(trackid) DESC
LIMIT 1;

#List the names and emails of all customers from the U.S.

SELECT firstname, lastname, email
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country='USA';

#Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp

JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId

JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId

WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND Inv.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY (round(sum(Inv.Total), 2))  DESC LIMIT 1;
